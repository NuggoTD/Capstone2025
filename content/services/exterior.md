When you pull into your driveway, we want you to feel proud of what you see.

At Andrew Heidelberger Construction, we help Minnesota homeowners upgrade their exteriors with care and craftsmanship. Whether it’s a new deck, updated siding, or better windows and doors — we focus on solutions that make your home more comfortable, more functional, and more *you*.

Living in Minnesota means dealing with weather that changes on a dime — scorching summers, freezing winters, and everything in between. We build with that in mind, using materials and methods that stand up to the climate and last for years to come.

We’re a small, local team — not a big-box contractor. That means we take the time to understand what you really need, and we keep communication open from start to finish.

No gimmicks. No pressure. Just solid work from people who care about doing things right.
